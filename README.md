#MicrolearningGenerator
A Python-based tool to generate bite-sized learning content (e.g., flashcards, quizzes) from educational resources like videos, articles, or text inputs. This project automates downloading, transcribing, processing, and generating microlearning materials using modern NLP techniques.
Features

Content Downloader: Fetches resources from URLs (e.g., YouTube videos, articles) using downloader.py.
Transcription: Converts audio/video content to text with transcriber.py.
Text Processing: Summarizes and extracts key points using processor.py with NLP tools like Hugging Face's BART and NLTK.
Content Generation: Creates microlearning materials via generator.py.
Modular Design: Organized utilities in the utils folder for extensibility.

Tech Stack

Python: Core language (3.8+).
Hugging Face Transformers: For text summarization and NLP tasks.
NLTK: For text processing and tokenization.
OpenAI API (optional): For advanced text generation (with local model fallback).
yt-dlp: For downloading YouTube videos.
SpeechRecognition: For audio-to-text transcription.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/MicrolearningGenerator.git


Navigate to the project directory:cd MicrolearningGenerator


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Set up environment variables (e.g., OpenAI API key, if used) in a .env file.

Usage
Run the main script with a URL or text file as input:
python main.py --url "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example"

The tool will:

Download the resource (if applicable).
Transcribe audio/video to text.
Process and summarize content.
Generate microlearning materials (e.g., flashcards).

Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher.
Dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

Troubleshooting

ModuleNotFoundError: Ensure all modules are correctly imported via utils/__init__.py.
OpenAI API Error (429): Switch to local models (e.g., BART) if API quota is exceeded.
